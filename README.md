## Example of Running Java Code for Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5:

Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5 each represents a distinct **Maven** project. So, all of them can be compiled and run tests the similar way as the following:

### **To compile any file in Q5:**

```bash
cd Q5
mvn compile
```

### **To run all tests corresponding to Q5:**

```bash
mvn test
```
